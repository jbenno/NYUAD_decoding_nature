The html script [html_boilerplate.html](https://github.com/jbenno/nyuad_decoding_nature/blob/master/01_Introduction/html_boilerplate.html) is a simple template for a single web page to display the code in [test1.js](/test1.js)./
Results can be viewed here: [https://jbenno.github.io](https://jbenno.github.io/nyuad_decoding_nature/01_Introduction/html_boilerplate.html)/

There are a number of free editors for html, Javascript, and other languages, e.g. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/), and many others. Please feel free to try out and use whatever you feel comfortable with.

p5js.org provides a simple editor and sandbox environment, too. It is a very good first start to play arround with Javascript: [https://editor.p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org).
