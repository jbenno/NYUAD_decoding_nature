# Final Project

The final project can be any form of *decoded nature* - an application done in `p5.js`, `processing`, or `python`. The project should follow your concept that expresses your creativity and be inspired by your research.

The concept makes your thoughts explicit. First, it lays out the sources (things you have researched, like papers, books, websites, other people's code, also functions in code libraries which may not yet have been covered in class). The research should give your project a conceptual frame. It should show that you can on your own build on what you have learned.

The creative concept presents your idea, the point of differentiation of the project, and leads through the aesthetic decisions you make.

The goal is to have the project be presentable at the IM show case.

### Examples of interactive media and generative art

[Art](/10_Final_Project/Art.md)

### Requirements

#### Project concept, documentation and prestenation
- Based on your research
- Showing a thoughtful concept
- Well documented process (Make slides or a short paper of ca. 1500 to 3000 words on how you came up with the concept; show the drafts/sketches and explain your design decisions; tell about the development with the problems and difficulties you faced)
- Well documented code
- Documented user testing
- A slide deck of web-presentation of 3 to 5 slides explaining your project and introducing it to the class

#### Technical achievments
- The application will be based on `p5.js`, `processing`, or `python`
- The application should be interactive - it takes inputs from users, exteral data, sensors, the camera, etc. and reacts
- The application delivers a sensual user experience (it uses dynamic graphics, and/or animation, and/or sound, etc.)
- Everything runs and can be presented at IM show case

*Extra Credits:*
- Include something pysical
- Responsive or mobile friendly design
- Accessibility
