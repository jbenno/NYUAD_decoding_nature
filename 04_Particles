# Assignments
- Your first project. Build something using what we have introduced so far. Concept and creativity will be the main focus - don't worry if it is technically not too brilliant. Simple but beautiful things are always welcome.
- Suggest a technical topic to present in class (e.g. Github, some JavaScript library that you know, some mathematical or physical concept that you find interesting, generative art).
