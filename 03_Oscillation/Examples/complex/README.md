# Complex numbers
complex.js contains a class with the basic funktions to work with complex numbers. The numbers are defined as 2-dimensional vectors (a,b) where the multiplication function multc works in the way to make sure that (0,1).multc(0,1) === (-1,0) which is equivalent to the axiom that the imaginary number i has the property of i^2 === -1.
