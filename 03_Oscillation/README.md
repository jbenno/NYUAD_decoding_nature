# Week 3: Oscillation etc.

(unrelated to oscillation, however very much related to nature and code): Using physical things to compute, Frei Otto, the engineer who built the Munich Olympic stadium, photographed frozen soap bubbles to determine minimal surfaces which in the 1960s where way to complicated to actually calculate on machines:

### Trigonometry
* Polar coordinates
* Unitary circle, sin and cos

### Angular movements

### Harmonic Oscillation
* Newton's laws and circular movements
* Springs
* Waves
* Fourier transformation
* Lissajous curves

### Examples
