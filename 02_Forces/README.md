# Week 2: Forces, Laws of Motions
(and some maths concepts)

### Vectors and Algebra
- Scalars, addition and subtraction, dot-products, absolute value
- Speed and velocity
- Differential change: Velocity as the differential of change in position, acceleration as the differential of change in velocity.

### Laws of Motion
- Updating discrete systems: calculating the next stage from the current state

### Forces
- Gravity
- Attraction
- Friction

### Examples

[Newton's first law](/02_Forces/Examples/movement1.js)
[Gravity](/02_Forces/Examples/gravity1.js)
[Potential and kinetic Energy](/02_Forces/Examples/bouncing_ball1.js)
[Illustration of Aristoteles' law of motion](/02_Forces/Examples/aristoteles.js)
[Nature of Code: Attractor](https://editor.p5js.org/natureofcode/sketches/HyWqel-de)

### Assignment
- Explore the p5.Vector. Code some nice illustration of vector algebra. Just as a reminder: Dan Shiffman's examples can be found in his [Github](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js/tree/master/chp01_vectors)
- Code a single particle system (like the coin or the die) that changes according to some law of motion. Can be H->T as in my example but of course can be anything, like changing color etc.. Also the phase space of the system doesn't have to be limited; could be integers (as in my odd/even example) or multidimensional (like RGB-color values).
- Build a planetary system with a few planets orbiting their sun (may of course have multiple suns)

### Reading (optional)
A very good (although very sophisticated) introduction to classical mechanics is Leonard Susskind's lecture - I use a lot of his didactics in this class:
